# jQuery OxbowStilt Widget

OxbowStilt is a lightweight jQuery UI Widget that turns a Select element into a two-list multi-select.

There are already [lots][1] of very good jQuery multi-select widgets around; however the aim of OxbowStilt 
is to work well in browsers with slow javascript (such as IE7, IE8) but when large numbers of items need to be shown.
For that reason, OxbowStilt aims to make minimal changes to the DOM.

Usage:

    $("#demo1").oxbowstilt();
	
... where 'demo1' is an existing Select element.
